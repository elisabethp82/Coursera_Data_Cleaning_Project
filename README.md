# Coursera Data Cleaning Project: the "run_analysis.R" Script explained
by Elisabeth Pelikan

This repository was produced for a course assignment during the “Getting and Cleaning Data” course by Jeff Leek, Roger D. Peng and Brian Caffo from Johns Hopkins University and distributed on the learning platform coursera.com.

The dataset used (Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset; Version 1.0)
is provided by the University of California. It can be downloaded from the following address: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Here’s a brief introduction to the experiments, as can be found in the readme file provided along with the dataset. 

“The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.”

Information about the __data processing__ can be found in the accompaning Codebook.
